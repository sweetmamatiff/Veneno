You start out small,

but the more you eat, the bigger you get.

And the bigger you get, the harder things get,

because the space doesn't change,

it's always the same four walls.

And suddenly one day, you notice that you've changed,

you're completely different, and you don't fit anymore.

Until your ass smacks you in the face, and then you die.
