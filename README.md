# Veneno
I'm the magic i'm the fairy!!! This is my first created repository! Just personal notes :) peace love and cheetos

-What's so funny?
-You are.

You think I'm funny?
Finally someone believes it!

Do we have the video or not?

I don't get what's going on tonight.

You're making them nervous.
Oh, here we go.

Your son's awake.

Did you feel this feminine
when you were a man?

Yes, exactly the same.

-Since when do you feel like a woman?
-Since I was born.

I used to dress up
in my mother's clothes.

-So you were sure about it then?
-Completely sure.




-But the village where I grew up...
-Hey, what're you doing up?

-You have school tomorrow.
-didn't understand this,

so I moved to Madrid,
where I made a good friend,

and that's when I said:
"Let's do this".

THIS STORY IS BASED
ON THE MEMOIR WRITTEN

BY CRISTINA ORTIZ, LA VENENO,

AND ON THE ACCOUNTS OF THE
PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES SHE CHANGED.

AS A STORY PRODUCT OF THE MEMORY,
IT HAS A BIT OF REALITY AND FICTION.

AND, AS IN ALL FICTIONAL STORIES,
IT HAS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY TRUE.

Oh! Man.

-Aw man, I lost again!
-Here, lemme try, it's my turn.

No. I wanna go again,
my finger just slipped.

You are totally addicted, Amparo.

-Addicted?
-Yeah.




You're addicted to weed,
and I don't say anything, Rubén.

Yes you do, every day.

Come on, gimme a turn.

-Here.
-Thanks.

-Hey, Rubén.
-What?

Have you ever noticed
that this game is like life?

-What are you saying?
-It is, totally. Check it out.

You start out small,

but the more you eat,
the bigger you get.

And the bigger you get,
the harder things get,

because the space doesn't change,

it's always the same four walls.

And suddenly one day,
you notice that you've changed,

you're completely different,
and you don't fit anymore.

Until your ass smacks you
in the face, and then you die.

-Geez, you're making me all paranoid.
-Why wouldn't you be paranoid?

Life is rough, Rubén.
You have to think sometimes.

-Hey, honey. Got a light?
-He does.

Whoa! Nice schlong.

-I can tell you mean business.
-No.

Thanks, bad boy.

Do you know who that was?
Did you see? No way!

-Did you see...?
-Excuse me. You...

-You're La Veneno.
-Of course I'm La Veneno, honey.

World famous.

-What're you doing in Valencia?
-I've got some gigs.

Awesome!

-You saw her grab my dick, right?
-Of course she did!

It was the least she could do, Rubén.
Do you know who that was?

GUESS WHO I JUST SAW

URGENT

WHO, BITCH?

INCREDIBLE!

WHO?

LA VENENO!

CHAPTER 1 THE NIGHT WE
CROSSED THE MISSISSIPPI

With this bombshell of a woman,

"Being young" is another look at
the dark side of the American dream.

Are we in the presence
of a new talent or not?

The truth is when it comes to looks,
they aren't always deceiving.

-Hey girl!
-Hi.

-What're you doing here?
-Just visiting.

What a surprise.
If you'd let us know,

-we'd have brought you a little gift.
-No, it's fine.

-Hey, congratulations.
-Thank you.

-ETA continues to kill.
-Love you.

-Sonia.
-Hey girl!

How are you, sweetie?
Lemme see. You look great.

I can't wait to meet your baby.
I'm sorry I couldn't come visit.

-I sleep all morning.
-No worries.

It's hard work at night.
I just can't wake up.

-Don't worry.
-I have to tell you about Romario.

-What happened?
-Sonia Monroy, first call.

-Really?
-Yep... Look who's here. No way.

No, no. Look, I even have a video.
I'm willing to tell you everything.

-Absolutely everything!
-Keep your voice down.

-Faela, what're you doing here?
-Mari!

-I'm so happy to see you.
-How are you?

-Come with me.
-How's it going?

I've beem the last two hours in
the dressing room with Mario Conde.

Looks like he wants to sing
with one of Los Brincos.

Out of the blue,
and with the mess he's in.

-I tell you, this place...
-No, no, I'm following you guys.

-And it's really turning out...
-It's good, yeah.

You shoulda seen Carlotti yesterday
with two huge cured hams,

coming through the crowd to greet us.
Listen, I've to go.

Hey, how's the new girl?

Machús?

She's OK, but not like you.

See you.

You jerk!

-What's up?
-I can't stand her.

-She'd put Judas to shame.
-Video's up in 15 seconds.

Let's go to the story. Cut to camera.
Hurry up, guys.

-Have you seen her segments?
-She's not a journalist.

Of course she's not.

She's like Mama Chicho or something,
but she's no journalist.

And now, let's hear it
for Machús Osinaga.

-What?
-The ones upstairs want her onscreen.

The girl's easy on the eyes, so...

What've you got today?

Well, today I've got a man
with a Super Dick!

-Yep, that's right.
-We'll have to wait a few minutes,

we've gotta cut to commercial.

Then, Juan Ignacio Blanco
with new passwords.

Don't touch that dial.

And, we're out.
Juan Ignacio, first call.

Makeup please.

-Faela! What're you doing here?
-I wanted to see you.

I can't stay locked up
in my house all day, right?

-I want to talk about...
-I'm listening.

-Let me introduce you.
-How's it going? Nice to meet you.

Yeah, we've already...
Pleasure. Great.

How amazing, right?
Man, it's gotta be incredible.

What?

-Being a mom.
-Oh, yeah, it's incredible.

-And a surprise, right?
-Could we have a moment, please?

Yeah sure, of course.

Two minutes, guys.

-What?
-Reporters on set?

Since when?

I can see that motherhood suits you.

Tell me about it.
No, seriously. The new girl on set?

-Anything you'd like to share?
-Yes, Faela.

We've got a show every single day
and we need to try new things.

Next time I'll run it by you
so you can give me the OK.

Alright, we're coming up
on the end of the break.

-Places, everyone.
-Faela.

Faela.

Good seeing you, I miss you.

-Here, sweetie.
-Alright, and in...

-Five, four...
-Hey, I'm on my way, OK?

Great.

How's Lucas?

Alright.

Is he sleeping?

Great, that's perfect.

Hey, Mom?

Thank you.

Look out, bitch!
You almost run me over!

-What's your deal?
-Sorry, I'm sorry.

Look, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

In her book "The Spiral of Silence",
Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann

examines public opinion
as a form of social control

in which individuals shape
their behavior to the prevailing

attitudes about what is acceptable
and what is not.

Neumann theorizes that society
threatens individuals with isolation

if they express positions that
stand in contrast to the majority.

Let me clarify so you all understand.

As individuals,
we are trained to perceive

the dominant climate of opinion,

and we base our responses
on that climate.

U SURE IT WAS HER?

TOTALLY!

U HAFTA TELL ME EVERYTHING

There is a theory in the book,
that it's wonderful.

SURE, COME WHEN YOU WANT.

OK!

C U, LUV

Sorry.

-It's just my friend saw La Veneno.
-Who?

Cristina, La Veneno.
Here, in Valencia. I'm freaking out.

What're you talking about?
Who cares? We're in class.

Silence please, if you would.
Thank you.

Just a minute, listen up.

This book is an extremely important
sociological keystone.

It poses an essential question
for you, as journalists.

Just a moment! There is a question
here that is really important,

about the role that the media
plays in our society.

Read the book and write
an outline for next week.

A journalistic one,
I don't want it simple.

Don't make it boring, alright?

That's it, you're free to go.

-What's she like?
-Enjoy, guys.

Fat, but beautiful.
She was fat, but so beautiful.

Like a cross between
a superhero and a virgin.

-Come on, girl, a virgin...
-Like an apparition of the Virgin.

And lemme tell you,
she has gigantic tits.

Oh my god, Cristina, La Veneno.

-But she was in jail.
-Yeah.

-La Veneno? From TV?
-One and the same.

That's right, from TV.

I ran straight into her.
We're this close, like you and me.

What's she doing here, Amparo?
I don't get it.

-She said she had some gigs.
-Gigs?

Gigs? No way.

-She's with the La Fe girls.
-The what now?

-The girls from the Hospital.
-Those hookers?

Hey, who asked you?

Just because she's trans,
you assume she's a prostitute?

-She's had lots of gigs in Valencia.
-Honey, I live around there,

and she's always stopping cars.

But I'm a big fan, I love her.

Peace out! See ya.

Geez, I knew he was gay.
I just knew it.

If his mom finds out,
she'll have a heart attack.

Complete gay.
You know, like you.

-Amparo.
-What?

Can we go to hospital?

-Why all the screaming?
-They're supposed to be here by now!

We've been here since 6:00
and they're still not here.

-Who's still not here?
-Take That.

If they're not coming,
then they should just say so.

-Right. Why all the tears?
-I'm fed up!

My nerves are shot.

All running around:
"They're coming this way".

"No, over here".
Stepping all over each other,

-dropping their purses...
-I think they'll be here soon.

-And what if they're not?
-I'll just kill myself, cause...

-No...
-Aren't we enough fans form them?

Gary, I love you!

They're fucking crazy.

Some came with their moms,
and they were worse than the girls.

-Incredible.
-I can't even, honestly.

-Great job, Machús.
-Thanks.

-We'll edit it and use it tonight.
-Great.

We'll put it between Tristán Braker,
from the Vallecas scandal,

-and Beatriz Rico.
-OK.

And tonight we've also got
"The Half Lemon".

How many lemons is that now?

For those of you who don't know,
Faela, our supermommy

is back early
from her maternity leave.

Welcome back!

You take your time and when
you've got a story, let us know.

-I've already got a story.
-Is that right?

Well, I don't know if...

Well, I've got a source in Lavapiés
who does whatever I want.

One of these weirdo sex workers.
We'll spend the day together,

-and I'll report on the experience.
-Machús did that a few days ago.

-Yeah, but...
-At the Sex Fair, in Barcelona.

But it wouldn't be organized
and clean like that.

Faela, we need some new stuff.
What else do we have?

-Can we have the mime on tomorrow?
-No, not the mime. No.

He does that bit you like about
Felipe González

-and the English classes.
-No, please, not the mime.

And we'll compare Felipe González's
dick to Bill Clinton's.

-No.
-The police in Galicia

are looking into some satanic rituals
in an abandoned church.

No. Doesn't anybody...?

We have a father and daughter
who think they were abducted and...

-Don't we have anything...?
-I think I've got something...

for Faela.

I've two lesbian friends
who have got a bar in Chueca

and they're having a protest wedding.
Tonight.

We've got the "Barb Wire" premiere,
and we've got Pamela,

-so I can't go.
-Yeah, but that's...

You take it, Faela, OK?
I think that'll do it, right, Mari?

Yes, it's done.

And come in prepared tomorrow,
cause today was a bit dull, OK?

-Pepe, the auditions.
-Hope you called in some good ones.

-Pepe, more lesbians? Really?
-Yes.

What's so special about them?

You just said we need something new.
Jesus, my sister is a lesbian.

-But it's a wedding.
-It's just a sham.

-You should've stayed home.
I'm not gonna do a shitty story.

-I have lots of ideas.
-I haven't slept in three days.

Your kid might be perfect,
but mine isn't.

I've gotta watch 2000 auditions tapes
and I'm starting to get tired.

-You sure you're ready to come back?
-Yes.

Then you're doing
the lesbian wedding, my friend.

Now if you don't mind.

-We're drawing attention.
-My boyfrind likes this music.

-Turn the music off.
-Don't touch anything, it's a mess.

You push that button, it starts
to smoke, then it starts flashing.

Quite a place, isn't it? Jesus

-This is it.
-Here?

Look, look, look.

-Do you think they're all trans?
-I don't know.

I'll go ask them, if you like.
Geez...

Who are these little hotties?
Newbies to the back of the line.

And if you don't have boobs yet,
go with the transformers.

The internet is fucking up
our entire business.

Here we go again, you're so annoying.

Go up and down, and stop cars.

-Hey.
-Hi.

-What you want?
-We're looking for Cristina.

-From Huelva?
-No, La Veneno.

Paca knows about that.

-Chesca!
-What?

+-Where's Paca?
-The Piranha?

-Yeah.
-She's tied up.

-Yeah, she's busy.
-OK, well...

-Thanks anyway.
-Just wait.

She'll be right back.
Just relax.

What's the big hurry?
We don't bite.

So what was I saying?
Leave your nails alone.

-Oh my God...
-Have you read the book "The Secret"?

-The secret of your coochie maybe.
-Hats, chips, beer, Coca-Cola...

Manolito, you look like a
Christmas tree. Cutie!

-He's adorable.
-I can't believe him.

-What're you staring at?
Want a picture or what?

No. Sorry...

-I love your bag.
-Oh yeah? It's "TELVA".

-"TELVA"?
-Look, "TELVA".

It's perfect for two condoms,
four wipes, two lipsticks...

Just leave your nails alone!

-You're driving me crazy.
-Vane, here comes Paca.

Paca!

-What?
-They're looking for La Veneno.

I'm coming.

-Look.
-Who are these outsiders?

-I don't know.
-Hello.

Hello. Good evening.
Who are you looking for?

-We wanted to meet La Veneno.
-Oh honey, there's no Veneno here.

-Who told you she was here?
-I saw her the other day.

The other day? You must
been drunk, ain't no Veneno here.

-Of course I saw her, man.
-"Man"? Got my pussy in the back,

but take a look at my rack.
Now get outta here.

-I swear to God I saw her.
-Amparo, let it go.

Good night now.
Take care and drive safe.

-Who are them? Is there a fight?
-They're... No, honey.

-Fight! Fight!
-Listen here.

The things I have to put up with.
Stop with the nails!

Fine, geez.

-You didn't say anything, right?
-I didn't make a peep.

I hope so. If they come asking
about La Veneno, she's not here.

I'm gonna deliver her
cigarettes and her magazine.

-Girl smokes like a chimney.
-May God bless you.

If those two come back, silence.
Over and out.

-Ugh, forget it.
-The bar's closed.

I know girls like this.
You have no idea.

-Dykes can be really intense.
-No, come on, Machús.

I'm talking about Machús.
She's yanking my chain,

this whole thing is a set-up.
Know who I saw her with today?

-Who?
-Rober.

-And what were they up to?
-Don't you know the story?

There once was an actress so dumb,
she hooked up with the writer.

Really?

-What're you doing? Smoking?
-I've already had my baby.

True.

What do we do?
Want a drink? A beer or two?

No, forget it.
I need... I need a story.

-Well, you're the boss.
-Come on.

Come on, let's go.

I know that face.

-No, Faela, we can't record here.
-Why not?

Not even the cops come here.

Oh my god.

-Let's go.
-For crying out loud.

Oh shit, the mic. Here.

The camera, someone's coming.

Sound check. Everything OK?
Turn it on, turn it on.

Hello. Excuse me. Stop, please.

Good evening. Are you hoping
to hire a prostitute?

Do you know what kind of
prostitution goes on here, sir?

Let's go.

-We're not gonna get anything.
-Wait, wait. We got this, come on.

-Hello.
-Don't film me!

-Don't go. You look amazing.
-Fuck off.

-And you look like shit.
-Wow.

-No one's gonna talk.
-Wait. Look, look.

Stop, stop, stop!

What a jerk.

-Faela, let's go. That's enough.
-Just a second.

Do you know what time it is?
It's dangerous around here.

People get killed.

Please.
Do you want that to happen to us?

Calm down, please.

-Pablo.
-No, stop ignoring me.

Ever since you got back,
I was excited to see you,

-but you're being impossible.
-Pablo, will you look?

Jesus!

Roll.

-Hello. Mind if we ask some questions?
-Of course not, honey.

-Go ahead and ask.
-You look amazing.

Well, I like the good life,
high fashion.

-Different outfit every night?
-Yes, like the bombshell I am.

-What are you: a man or a woman?
-What am I?

-I'm a blinking light, honey.
-Ahat are you dressed as?

-A sultan?
-I dunno what I am, honestly.

Sultan, courtesan, Indian...
Like Pocahontas,

-but with a shark.
-What's this about a shark?

What's the shark?

The shark is coming.

It's what's between my legs.
What else would the shark be?

-How much?
-I'm expensive.

I don't even wanna say, cause...

Hang on, sweetie.

-Get the car.
-On it.

It's 10,000.
Wadda you say, honey?

-Well fuck you very much.
-How much did that tightwad offer?

5,000. 5,000 for a BJ,
I'm worth way more than that.

-What's a BJ?
-You don't know what a BJ is?

It's pretty intense.

-How about going bareback?
-No.

You're clueless.

Well imagine

this is a spicy lollypop.

So you put on the condom

so you don't spill,
so everything stays inside.

-And then where do you put it?
-Where do I put it?

In my pussy. Clear as day.

Hang on a sec.

-What do I do?
-Roll, roll.

You wanna do it?

-She's leaving.
-See ya, sweetie.

And practice your BJ,
it's gonna change your life.

-That was amazing.
-Unbelievable.

-Let's get some b-roll, c'mon.
-I cannot believe this.

-How about here?
-This is good.

-But all these cars...
-Hurry.

-You say the word.
-I got you. Whenever you're ready.

-We're...
-Rolling.

We're standing
in Madrid's West Side Park,

where every night things happen
that no one ever talks about.

Wait. Keep rolling, just in case.

-Turn that off.
-Calm down.

-Turn that off!
-Careful with the camera!

-Hey, get Norma. Tamara!
-What's wrong?

-Go get Manuela.
-What happens?

-Gimme the tape.
-It's just b-roll.

-Don't touch the camera.
-What b-roll you fucking bitch?

We're all shopping our pussies off
so you can come laugh at us?

-We're working too, just like you.
-Just calm down, OK?

-What is this? Gimme the tape.
-We're not recording you.

-It's just about the park.
-We'll give you the tape.

-Give it to her now!
-Dude, gimme the tape.

-But what're you doing?
-Don't, you'll make it worse.

-You're making me do this.
-What? What's going on?

-This bitch is recording us.
-What're you doing here?

What are you, deaf?
Fuck you all to hell.

I'm gonna kick your ass.
-Hey!

-You shut your mouth.
Hey!

Wadda you mean, "hey"?
Now gimme the tape

-or I'll tear your eyes out.
-What's going on here?

-They're filming all of us.
-What're you doing here?

-We weren't filming them.
-Then what were you recording?

-You can't film here. We're working.
-Give her the tape and let's go.

-Yeah, give it and leave
-Give it to her, Jesus.

-Go get Tito.
-That's right, get Tito.

-Tito! Tito!
-Wait, Tito's coming.

-Let's see the tape.
-You can't film here.

-Let me have her, I'll kill her!
-Here comes Tito.

-Gimme the tape.
-You'll pay for this, you bitch.

Give us the tape
or you're gonna regret it.

What the fuck is going on?

Tito, they were filming us,
they're gonna play it on TV.

What're you recording?

-We weren't filming them.
-Liar!

-They filmed us, and La Veneno.
-We didn't record them.

-What did you record then?
-The park.

-It's better to give him the tape.
-Gimme the tape.

I'm sorry, but I can't.

-You can't?
-Give him the tape.

-Gimme the fucking tape.
-Faela!

.-OK, fine.
-Give him the tape and let's go

Fine, fine, I'll give it to you.
Just calm down, please.

-Get down on your knees.
-OK, OK, give him the tape.

There's the tape. Let him go.
Let him go, we're leaving.

Smash it!

-We're leaving.
-My wife works down there,

and nobody films her.

Tito, not your wife
or anyone else, alright?

-We're leaving.
-Oh, you're leaving?

-You're not going anywhere.
-No! No, please.

-Come here, slut!
-No.

-No, not in the car! Ow!
-Here we go.

-Fuck her up.
-Bitch.

I'm in charge here, you hear me?
And no one films my wife!

Wait, just listen, I'm begging you.
Listen to me.

Please, listen to me.

We're leaving.
I have a baby at home.

Please, don't kill me, I beg you.
I am so freaked out.

-Let her go, come on.
-Let her go, Tito.

If I ever see you again,
or this asshole over here,

-I'll kill you both, you hear me?
-Tito, Jesus, let her go.

-I'm going, I'm going, come on.
-That's enough now.

-Let go of her. Now leave.
-Go on now, faggot.

-Go on, bitch.
-Get out of here! Fuck you!

-And everyone you know!
-Come on, back to work.

Forget about her.

Holy shit!

Mother fucker.

Are you OK?
Jesus Christ, I'm shaking.

Come on, let's go. You alright?
Let's go.

-Look.
-What?

-What's that?
-The tape, asshole.

Jesus Christ...

Let's go now!

For the love of god.
What're you waiting for?

Pepe, I'm sorry,

but we don't have
anything ready to go.

-Something you must have.
-Llast night was complicated.

-The Chueca story didn't work out.
-I know, I'm sorry.

So all we've got is this,
but it's pretty rough.

-Well let's see what you got.
-Well this is great.

Know who I saw her with today?

-Who?
-Rober.

-And what were they up to?
-Don't you know this story?

There once was an actress so dumb
she hooked up with the writer.

Fast forward, fast forward the tape.

Wait a second. Look, look.

Stop, stop, stop!

-Hi! Mind if we ask some questions?
-Of course not, honey.

You look amazing.

Well I like the good life,
high fashion.

-Different outfit every night?
-Yes, like the bombshell I am.

See? This part...

What am I?
I'm a blinking light, honey.

-What're you dressed as, a sultan?
-I dunno what I am, honestly.

Sultan, courtesan, Indian...
Like Pocahontas,

-but with a shark.
-What's this about a shark?

What's the shark?

The shark is coming.

It's what's between my legs.
What else would the shark be?

-How much?
-I'm expensive.

I don't even wanna say, cause...

Hang on, sweetie.

Hats off, Faela, this is exactly
what I've been looking for.

I knew you'd come through.

Thank you. Really.

-Great, so this runs tonight.
-Perfect.

-And tomorrow I want her here.
-What?

Go back to the park,
and bring her on the show.

Pepe, you have no idea
how dangerous it is there.

I reported from Iran.
Take Pablo. He'll protect you.

Who, me?

-I can't. I'll be on set.
-Can't you switch with someone?

No.

I'll go with her.

I love you girls together.

You'll go as a pair.

Faela, you never shoulda crossed
the Mississippi, pilgrim.

-Alright, let's go.
-That's right...

-Have you had breakfast?
-No.

Let's see.

Faela.

What? What the fuck do you want?

I'm sorry
for what happened yesterday.

I got the day wrong,
I already told Pepe.

Look, Machús, you can't fool me, OK?

Yesterday you screwed me.

And now you wanna come with me
to take the credit.

I don't mind if you wanna come,
but you can cut the shit.

-You're totally wrong about me.
-I don't think so.

You are.

You don't remember me, right?

I was an intern on "Todo va bien"
a couple of months before it ended.

I really wanted to work with you.

Because I've always been a big fan.

Yoy might be right.

I'm so stupid that I've fallen
in love with the writer.

But it is what it is.
I worked hard to get where I am.

And if you don't believe it,
that's your problem.

Rocío Jurado's health is getting
worse and worse.

She is always accompanied
by her husband,

the bullfighter José Ortega Cano,
and their daughter, Rocío Carrasco.

And now La Veneno,
Spain's most famous prostitute.

Mom, could you turn that up?

...on the darkest of nights,
she is back.

Her image,
so different from 10 years ago,

and her time behind bars
has left us perplexed."

-Hey, that's Valencia.
-Looks like the new part.

...leaving behind a life
of ups and downs.

Is La Veneno from here?

-Where are you going?
-I have to run, Mom.

-Will you be home for dinner?
-I don't know.

Take your key.

I finally get a day off, and here
we are like tourists in Valencia.

I'd have preferred the City of Arts
and Sciences, not Marchalenes.

- I know where we are.
-I've only been here once before.

It was a party.

-You can imagine.
-Wait. Hang on a sec.

-It has to be one of these.
-Right. One of these.

Or one of those, or those.
There are tons of buildings!

Amparo, if you wanna leave,
then go, but stop complaining.

No, I wanna help.
I wanna be here with you.

But we've been walking around
for the last two hours.

I know that, Amparo.

Well I honestly don't know
how we're gonna find her.

-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

Excuse me.

-Do you know where La Veneno lives?
-Second floor on the left.

Thank you.

-Come on, let's do this.

Let's go.

-Yes?
-Hello.

-Hello. Who's there?
-We're looking for La Veneno.

La Veneno? No, honey,
this is Paqui the Piranha's house.

-We were told she lived here.
-No, you were told wrong.

I'm sorry, who's calling?

-We're fans of hers.
-Oh, fans.

Well, she doesn't live here,
alright?

-OK, bye now.
-Goodbye.

-Bye.
-Fuck her and her fucking fans.

-Who was it, Paca?
-Nobody, hon.

-No need to know every little thing.
-Nobody? Musta been somebody.

It was just one of my clients
but I told him I'm not available,

-told him to come back later.
-Don't lie, I heard you.

Then look, I'm gonna tell you.

They said:
"We're fans of La Veneno".

-What do you mean, fans?
-That's right, fans of La Veneno.

-My fans?
-Fans of La Veneno.

-And you didn't say anything?
-I told them you weren't here.

Where are you going?
I told them you don't live here.

C'mere, what are you, nuts?

Hey, are you my fan?

I am.

Come on up.

Let's go.

-Are you trans?
-No, I'm goth.

Come on up.

Paca, Paca.

-Look.
-Who is it?

-My fans.
-Hello.

-Well how are you?
-Hi.

I know these two,
from the other night.

I saw them on the street
when I went to buy your cigarettes.

-They were asking about you.
-Why don't you fix something?

Do you want some coffee or...?
Want a pastry, you sweet thing?

-I do.
-Look at her.

She looks like that girl
from "Star Wars".

-That one that looks like Chenoa.
-Go on now, fix us something.

Oh calm down, I'm going.

-So you're fans of mine?
-Ever since I can remember.

I'm a little overweight now,
but I'm slimming down.

-Oh stop, you look great.
-And you still have that essence.

Before I got locked up,
I weighed 63 kilos.

I was like a doll
with perky little tits.

-Right, Paca?
-Look, let's be honest.

She had a wasp-waist,
looked just like Betty Boop.

But now looks
like the bride of King Kong.

Oh shut up, stop it.
Get out the picture albums.

Look how happy you are now,
with your long drooling face.

You're about to see what
the Spanish bombshell was like.

More like a stink bomb.
Ugh, this one.

Here, sweetie,
look at these gorgeous pics.

-Look, look how scandalous.
-Gorgeous!

Look at that face, that body.
And those boobs!

That dress is by Pepe Rubio,
he made me scandalous outfits.

-And here, Marilyn Monroe.
-That was at the Joy Eslava,

they put on a fashion show for me
and it was crawling with press.

-Gorgeous.
-Here you look like a supermodel.

That was at the Illa Fantasía,

on the same night
Ricky Martin played there.

-Really?
-My pussy was pretty happy.

-Here comes the dirty stories.
-You're just jealous, Paca.

Jealous of what? My type is more
that Jean Claude Van Damme guy.

-Look.
-You're a total goddess.

I was on hormones
for three months there.

-Look at those tits.
-Just three months?

Yes, and look how gorgeous.

And you?

-What about me?
-When do you start?

-Start what?
-It's good to talk about things.

He's still young,
don't fill his head with that.

-I'm lost. What's going on?
-Wadda you think?

Your friend here has a secret.
And the cops aren't stupid.

He's one of us.

I just don't know
when the right moment would be.

Look, listen to me, I became
a woman at the age of 30.

That's when I became a bombshell.

You take your time,

and when the time is right,
go for it.

You'll leave everyone slack-jawed.
Because if this is who you are,

it's who you'll always be, baby.
Understand? Always.

It's something you carry inside
from the time you're born.

Now, you take your time,
and choose a spectacular name.

Vanessa, Penelope...

-Victoria.
-Or you could go with Natasha.

-Or Scheherezade.
-Whatever you want, honey,

but don't forget who you are,
if you do, you'll lose your beauty.

Like Marta from Asturias, who looked
like the father from "Pocahontas".

Sweetie, stop it,
don't go on about that stuff.

-What're you talking about?
-Let her do whatever she wants.

How can you even argue with that face?
She can't go wrong.

You're so tall and so beautiful,
you could be like Vanessa Estilo.

-Vanessa Estilo?
-Poor thing, may she rest in peace.

-Honey, she got killed by a client.
-Get the other albums,

-where I'm working on the street.
-Will you cool it with the albums,

-finish that one up first.
-You like that one?

I love it.

-Here honey, this one's for you.
-Thank you so much.

-Very inconspicuous.
-This way I'll blend in, right?

You're something else, Machús.

Now listen to me good, alright?

If get out of, they'll kill me,
so when you I see her, I'll say:

"That one". Then you jump out and get
her in the car super fast, OK?

Super fast. Got it?

Machús, this is really dangerous.

Machús, get back
in the car right now!

Are you crazy?

Jesus Christ, I can't believe this.

Hey lover, how are you?
So happy to see you.

-Who's that?
-Me. La Machús, who do you think?

-I know I owe you 2,000 pesetas.
-Well come on.

-You look gorgeous.
-Hey there.

Good evening, gentlemen.
How are you tonight, good?

See you later.

Chiqui.

Listen, quick question.
I'm looking for this tall girl...

Son of a bitch.

Hey, gorgeous.
What sounds good for dinner?

-No, no.
-A threesome?

-Dynamic lesbian duo, you and me?
-No, really, no.

If you change your mind,
I'm at your service, beautiful.

I cannot believe this.

-Can't you see I'm peeing here?
-Sorry.

-Machús, Machús, that's her!
-Why am I on TV?

-I just wanna talk to you.
-But your friend

-from yesterday put me on TV.
-But I'm not gonna do that.

-What would you think if...
-Cristina, isn't that the reporter?

-That's her. You bitch, c'mere.
-Cristina.

-Show your face.
-Please, just calm down.

-You little bitch.
-I'm just here to talk to you.

-Cristina, please, calm down.
-What? What?

-Veneno, I saw you on TV.
-What?

And I saw you on Roots, you fag.
Step aside.

-Faela!
-You ruined my life!

-You bitch!
-I just want to talk!

Can you get in the car
so we can talk?

-Hey you, from the TV!
-Who's that?

-What you want?!
-Come on, let's go!

Are you kidnapping me?

I told you never to show
your face here again!

-Go, just go!
-Stop the car.

-Why the screaming?
-Go, Jesus!

-Which way do I go?
-Tito, they took her!

-Stop that car!

-I'll have your heads!
-Where are you taking me?

Tito, they're getting away!

-Veneno, listen to me.
-Stop saying my name!

What is going on here?
You ruined my life!

Ever since you put me on TV,
little boys ask for my autograph.

Pepe Navarro wants you to work
on his show, "Mississippi".

-I'm not gonna...
-Oh, baby!

-What a scandal, the "Mississippi".
-Just leave me alone.

-Why wouldn't you want to?
-It's my turf and I call the shots.

-Veneno.
-What?

-How much do you charge?
-A lot.

-How much? Tell me.
-More than 50,000 a night.

Fine, on TV you'll be
making more than 100,000.

And if you do both,
you can make 200,000, come on!

-That's a whole mess of money!
-And what do I want with a mess?

Now will you just pull over
and let me be!

-Stop the car!
-Fine, OK, I'm stopping!

-It's alright, don't worry.
-I suck at this.

No, that's not true,
you're doing fine.

Come on now, Camille.

Honey, you didn't do anything wrong,
you just plowed on through

like we're all animals you're
looking at on safari.

You didn't even introduce yourselves.

I'm Paca The Piranha,
close friend of La Veneno.

You didn't introduce yourselves,
you just bulldozed your way in,

driving off the clients.
Of course she got mad,

of course the other day Tito
came close to killing you.

Gimme some paper.
Come on, a piece of paper.

-Some paper, bitch.
-There.

And here's a pen.

No, I've got my own pen.

I mean, honestly.
You really made a mess of things.

Here, this is Cristina's address,
you can speak with her in peace.

And please, next time
a little more tact.

-I promise.
-Thank you.

-Good night.
-Thanks.

Come here! Come here.

-We did it, girl!
-Jesus.

-Come on!
-Come on, let's go.

Hey there, you feel like doing it?
Wanna spend some time together?

Come on then, you're gonna
bring out the beast inside of me.

Paca, what happened?
I was taking a shit.

Our little girl is gonna be a star.

I knew it, honey,
I always knew she would.

-You like it, hon?
-I love it. Rocío Jurado.

It's a pretty altar, right?

I set it all up,
because she's been sick,

so the Lord will heal her.
I do her, you know?

-I do a really good Rocío Jurado.
-She's the best.

I'm a huge fan, her biggest fan.

-Should we go?
-You're not staying for dinner?

No, they can't stay.
I don't have enough food.

I've got enough for her,
but that's it.

-Then come back another day.
-Tomorrow I'll run to the market.

-OK.
-It was a pleasure.

-I know. We'll see you soon.
-Come back again,

-I've got tons of photo albums.
-See you, Princess Sheila.

Chenoa.
-Bye.

Be careful out there with the
bad guys.

She can really talk, can't she?

-She talked non-stop.
-She does talk a lot.

A little too much, if you ask me.

I'm gonna get going.

I've got a paper to write.
I'll be up all night working on it.

-I'll text you when I get home.
-OK.

A really smart girl.

What?

That's what I see
when I look at you.

A really smart girl.

You do?
Yeah.

Look, I'm like the snake in my game,

locked up inside four walls.

I go out through one door,
and come back in through another.

And I keep going til I've eaten
so much I can't fit.

But not you.

One day, you'll go out through a door
but youwon't come back.

And I'm gonna miss you so much,

but you're so much bigger
than these four walls.

Because your game
hasn't been invented yet.

Because your game is
the coolest ever.

-Amparo.
-What?

-You're addicted.
-I'm totally addicted.

But anyway...

Gotta run, girl.

I love you so much,
and I'll text you tonight, OK?

OK. Love you.

Fortunately or unfortunately,

I didn't meet Cristina
in the mid-90s.

I mean, I knew her like
everyone else in my generation

whose parents sent them
to bed at midnight

when it was time for Mississippi.

I'm trans? Yes, I am.

A prostitute? That too.
But I've got quite a pair.

And we were dying to see
that impressive woman,

who was something
from another planet.

-She's funny.
-I know, right?

-And she's gorgeous too.
-Beautiful.

Nocturnal and treacherous,
she entered into our homes

to give voice and body
to a subject that, up until then

had been a huge taboo.

A reality that society had decided
to look away from.

That was a rough start.

My name is Faela Sainz
and I work at "Mississippi".

I had a baby recently,

and I need to prove
I'm still good at my job.

I'd love it if you'd come with me.

And I think it could be
an incredible opportunity for you.

If I didn't, I wouldn't say so,
I swear.

It's nice to meet you, Faela.

But I can't be on TV.

Why not?

Because my mother has never
seen me like this.

-Like what?
-Like...

As a woman. She doesn't know me.

She doesn't know who I am now.

Do you understand?

Completely.

In case you change your mind.

-Thank you.
-No, thank you.

-Bye, Faela.
-Bye.

It was clear
that Cristina wasn't perfect,

but then, who is?

Is the TV perfect?

-No, I said I'm not going on TV.
-Is that your final answer?

-Yes.
-Fine.

I'm not gonna fight with you
anymore, it's not worth it.

You just keep suffering,
living in the past for your mother.

Keep doing what you've always done.
It's working for you.

But this is a huge opportunity
that's gonna pass you by,

just because you care about someone
who doesn't care about you.

Rocío Jurado passed away
at 5:15 this morning.

Oh, my Rocío, such a shame.

Next time those girls come,

I'm gonna show them
all the gowns I've got in there.

The black one, the polka dots,

the red one...
They won't believe their eyes.

My sweet Cristina,

you were so relaxed...

-You're just jealous.
-No, not jealous.

But I've seen that look
in your eyes before.

And it never led to anything good.

And now that I've lost
my Rocío Jurado,

I don't want anything to
happen to you, hon.

Did those shows take advantage
of her vulnerability

just so they could turn
her drama into higher ratings?

Profession: prostitute.
Price: more than 100,000 per night.

Or did they save her, by giving her
the opportunity of a lifetime?"

Ladies and gentlemen,
here with us tonight, live,

it's Cristina, La Veneno.

Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann argues
in "The Spiral of Silence"

that the responsibility lies
with the media,

because they draw the line between

what's socially accepted
and what's not.

Because they can transform prejudice

into empathy.

Darkness

into light.

And make visible what is invisible.

-Should I call you Cristina?
-Yes, call me Cristina,

because La Veneno is just a nickname.

-Is it because you're deadly?
-No, no...

-Great job.
-Thank you.

What do you have for tomorrow?

Nothing.

I'm gonna finish my maternity leave.

I wanna spend time with my son.

What will we do without you?

You've got Machús,
she's an excellent reporter.

-I'm laughing at you.
-Oh, you're laughing at me?

Finally, someone who laughs
at what I don't say.

-You've always been like this?
-She's special.

Of course she is.

Nobody's perfect,

but if Cristina hadn't appeared
on TV,

many others might have
remained in the shadows.

What you don't talk about it,
doesn't exist.

And what doesn't exist,
is marginalized.

Hello.

This is not an outline.

-I didn't know what approach to take.
-It's better than an outline.

Really?

-Did you really meet her?
-Yes.

-I've made up my mind.
-About what?

My name.

Valeria.

Come on in.
Paca, Paca, her name's Valeria.

There's no doubt she saved me.

Because she made me see
I wasn't alone.

And meeting her was the beginning
of the adventure of a lifetime.

Have you ever thought
about writing a book?

-A book?
-Yes. A book.
